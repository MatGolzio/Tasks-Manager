# Description of the project
Basically, it's a software (only for computers) that you use to organize your tasks, adding, removing and editing them.

# How was made
The main programming language used in the software is Python, the front-end part is a framework called of Tkinter, and for the back-end, I used SQL (MySQL) to save the tasks in a table inside a database.

# How to convert it in .EXE
To convert the .py  file in .exe is pretty simple, basically you download the software, go to the folder that you selected to download using a terminal, and after convert the file in .exe using the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pyinstaller/">pyinstaller library</a> made for Python.
